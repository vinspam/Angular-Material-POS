# Angular 4 POS

A basic point-of-sale demo application built in Angular 4. This project uses Angular Material UI elements (https://material.angular.io) and a Firebase Cloud Firestore backend.

The purpose is to demonstrate a simple POS using modern frameworks. Users can perform transactions, add/modify products, create new user accounts, and see a paginated transaction history.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.4.

Project built by Sam Finan (www.samfinan.com) for fun & games.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
