# Angular 4 POS

A basic point-of-sale demo application built in Angular 4. This project uses Angular Material UI elements (https://material.angular.io) and a Firebase Cloud Firestore and Firebase Auth backend (https://firebase.google.com).

The purpose is to demonstrate a simple POS using modern frameworks. Users can perform transactions, add/modify products (with image upload), create new user accounts, and see a paginated transaction history. Adding/removing users and products is restriced to Admin users.
